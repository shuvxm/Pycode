# => Searching, Sorting program

# => Sliding Window  technique questions like this to get the clue of this technique
#  -> finding subarray with given sum
#  -> find maximum sum of a subarray of size k
#  -> smallest window in a string containing all characters of other string
#  -> Length of the longest substring without repeating characters
#  -> Count distinct elements in every window of size k

# => Two pointers Algorithm:
#   -> Duplicate find
#   -> palindrome, pairs related, reverse(till specific index)
#   -> sorted then merge

# => Divide & Conquer Algorithm
# => Binary Search ( its extension of divide & conquer algo), only diff is Binary Search, we apply on sorted things(sorted array or sorted Linked List)
# => Recursion, Dynamic Programming (for optimization more)
